## INTRODUCTION TO OPEN AI GYM

OpenAi is an "Open source interface to reinforcement learning tasks.
The gym library provides an easy-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks." (https://gym.openai.com/)

Basically gives you multiple environments out of the box for you to train machine learning.

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It supports teaching agents everything from walking to playing games like pong or pinball. Gym is an open source interface to reinforcement learning tasks. Gym provides an environment and its is upto the developer to implement any reinforcement learning algorithms. Developers can write agent using existing numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano. (from : https://medium.com/@ashish_fagna/understanding-openai-gym-25c79c06eccb

### What is reinforcement learning

### Why games and reinforcement learning
If you can train a computer model to play a video game, you can train a model to drive a car automously or even automatically trade an investment account.
